			<h2>If you don&apos;t know why you&apos;re banned</h2>
			<p>
				We apologize for the inconvenience. There could be a mistake, or the ban reason was not
				communicated effectively. Assuming the ban was erroneous, provide the following
				information to help diagnose the issue. Otherwise, we can clarify the banning reason
				using the above nickname.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you&apos;re banned on a mobile phone, then you may not be banned. Mobile hosts are
				dynamic (change) and you could be assigned a host that was banned in the past. If you
				answer &quot;yes&quot; to this, try to enable then disable airplane mode to try and
				get a new host. If that does not work, turn your phone off and on.
